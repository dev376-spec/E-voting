    <p><b>Q.1  What is e-Voting?</b> <br />
        <br>
  <b>Ans.</b>  e-Voting is  voting  through  an electronic system where  shareholders can vote on <br />
  resolutions of  companies  requiring voting through Postal Ballot  as per extant rules  and <br />
  regulations without having the necessity of sending their votes through post. Ministry of <br />
  Corporate Affairs has authorised NSDL for setting up an electronic platform to facilitate <br />
  shareholders to cast vote in electronic form. Accordingly, NSDL has set-up an electronic <br />
  infrastructure to facilitate shareholders to cast votes in electronic form through internet. <br />
</p>
    <p><b>Q.2  What is the legal framework permitting e-Voting?</b> <br />
        <br>
    <b>Ans.</b>  The Companies (Passing of the Resolution by Postal Ballot) Rules, 2001, has defined the <br />
&ldquo;Postal Ballot as voting by shareholders by postal or electronic mode instead of voting <br />
personally by presenting for transacting businesses in a general meeting of the company&rdquo;. <br />
  Thus, Section 192A of the Companies Act, 1956 read with Companies (Passing of the <br />
  Resolution by Postal Ballot) Rules, 2001 recognizes voting by electronic mode for postal <br />
  ballot.  The Postal Ballot Rules, 2001 were Superceded by  Postal Ballot Rules, 2011, <br />
  which prescribed the appropriate mechanism for e-Voting. <br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Q.3  How will I benefit from the e-Voting System?</b> <br />
    <br>
    <b>Ans.</b>  (i)  Substantial reduction in administration cost viz., <br />
&#61692;  Postal correspondence <br />
&#61692; Verification of signatures <br />
&#61692; Counting of votes <br />
&#61692; Storing of physical ballot papers <br />
  (ii)  Accuracy in counting of votes. <br />

        holders of NSDL?</b></p> <br />
        <b>Ans.</b>  The e-Voting System of NSDL facilitates voting from all shareholders i.e., shareholders <br />
      holding shares in physical and demat mode with either NSDL or CDSL, as on the record <br />
      date.</span> <br />

        <p class="style1"><b>Q.5  How do I register for e-Voting facility ?</b></p> <br />
        <b>Ans.</b>  Browse  on the link <a href="https://www.evoting.nsdl.com">https://www.evoting.nsdl.com</a> and download registration related <br />
        information from Download section. <br />
      
        <p class="style1"><b>Q.6  Is there any User manual to understand the login and usage process ?</b></p> <br />
        <b>Ans.</b>  Yes. You can download the User manual from <a href="https://www.evoting.nsdl.com">https://www.evoting.nsdl.com</a>. <br />
      
      <p class="style1"><b>Q.7  There are demat accounts / shares certificates held by joint holders. In such a case 
          who will cast the vote in e-Voting System ?</b></p> <br />
        Ans.  As, only one of the several joint holders is entitled to exercise voting power, in case of <br />
        e-voting only first holder is recognized for the purpose of sending user ID &amp; password for <br />
        e-voting. Accordingly, the vote casted using the User ID and password sent to first holder <br />
        is  recognized on behalf of all the joint holders, as the shareholder who casts the vote <br />
        through the e-Voting services of NSDL is doing so on behalf of all joint holders. 
        <br>
      <p class="style1"><b>
          Q.8  Will proxy be able to cast vote in e-Voting System ?</b></p> <br />
        <b>Ans.</b>  e-Voting System brings flexibility, convenience and ease of operation for the shareholder <br />
      
        <p class="style1"><b>Q.9  Is time period for e-Voting same as Postal Ballot?</b></p> <br />
        <b> Ans.</b>  Yes. The time defined in the Postal Ballot Rules, 2001 for Postal Ballot is applicable for
        e-Voting as well. <br />
      
        <p class="style1"><b>Q.10  Can a shareholder modify a vote already casted before the closing of e-Voting cycle?</b></p> <br />
        <b>Ans.</b>  No. Vote once casted will be considered final and cannot be modified. <br />
      
      <p class="style1"><b>Q.11  Voting on selective resolutions is permitted in Postal Ballot. Is the same available in 
          the e-Voting System as well ?</b></p> <br />
        <b> Ans.</b>  Yes, since a shareholder can decide to vote only on some of the resolutions put to vote, <br />
        the same can also be done in e-Voting System as well. <br />
      
        <p class="style1"> <b>Q.12  How will the results be made available at the end of the voting period?</b></p> <br />
        <b> Ans.</b>  The Scrutinizer will download  and collate  the votes casted by the shareholders through <br />
        the e-Voting System of NSDL and votes received though other means to declare the final <br />
        results for the resolutions placed for voting by the Issuer. <br />
      
        <p><span class="style1"><b>Q.13  How will I know if e-Voting website is secured?</b></span></p> <br />
        <b> Ans.</b>  If you are visiting the website with a secure connection, you will be able to identify the <br />
        website through the site's certificate. A secure or encrypted website address will begin <br />
        with HTTPS rather than HTTP, and you will see a lock icon in the Address bar. Secure <br />
        connections use certificates to identify the website and to encrypt your connection so that <br />
        it will be more difficult for a hacker to view. You can also click the lock icon in the <br />
        Address bar to see more information about the secured website. <br />
